    <h1>5.0 Method</h1>
    <hr>
    
<p>This recipe is no longer backwards</p>

<h2>5.1 General Prep</h2>

<ol>
<li>Defrost your cuts and bones</li>
<li>If using bones, roast them to 400 degrees Fahrenheit for 30 minutes (after pre-heating the oven)</li>
<li>Defrost your steak or other cut of beef that you will use to cook in the bowl later on</li>

</ol>


<h2>5.2 Seasoning Prep</h2>
<ol>
<li>Peel all onions</li>
<li>Peel all ginger and wash it. it's ok if your peeling is imprecise (and some peel remains). Cut them into thin quarter inch slices.</li>
<li>Rinse the tsaoko cardamom, cilantro seeds, star anise, and cinnamon sticks and drain them to partially dry. Don't leave them dry for too long.</li>



</ol>

<h2>5.3 Seasoning Bake and Roast</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Dedicate half of your onions to this process. Wrap them in aluminum foil housing (open top) and bake or roast them (on stovetop burner) until yellow.</li>
    <ul>
<li>Among these onions, cut some cavities into them, without slicing them. I recommend thirds for smaller to larged sized onions, and quarters for extremely large onions. This allows onion-y steam to vent while baking them, but since they're wrapped in aluminum foil they will cook a bit more evenly with this onion-y goodness</li>
<li>Optional: among half of these onions (so 1/4 total onions) you can slice them into thirds or halves and char/grill them face down like the ginger step below</li>
<li>Onions are done when they smell nice, or</li>
<li>They are soft and ooze juice (when additional cuts are made)</li>
<li>They are charred evenly</li>
<li>Scrape off the char, if any</li>
</ul>

<li>Put ginger slices onto stovetop or face-down on a baking pan (wrapped in alum. foil)</li>
<ul><li>Do it until it smells nice. Scrape off charring with a knife.</li></ul>


<li>Cilantro seeds are up first: since they are still wet, put them into a hot pan to roast on medium-high to high heat. Slowly turn down the heat once water beads start to boil. Stir them like crazy to avoid burning (about 5 minutes in and monitor closely following this moment)</li>
<ul><li>They burn easily</li>
<li>They are finished when they are yellowed and smell nice. One or two may be burnt. They would be dry and crisp like potato chips. </li>
    <li>DO NOT BURN MORE THAN A FEW THIS WOULD GREATLY AFFECT THE FLAVOUR</li></ul>
<li>Start a small pot of water, fill it to about 3/5 to 4/5 the cylindrical height (because roasted onions will offset the volume later) and then add the cilantro seeds.</li>
<li>The pan is now empty and now add the star anise, tsaoko, and cinnamon sticks into the pan for roasting.</li>
<ul><li>Roast cinnamon until light charring</li>
<li>Roast tsaoko until the previously-shriveled spice is blown up and smoothened</li>
<li>Roast the star anise until is slightly enlarged and slightly charred</li></ul>
<li>Take out the tsaoko and smash it with a heavy object until it bursts open</li>
<li>Add these remaining spices into the water pot that was just created</li>
<li>Add the baked onions and roasted ginger into pot.</li>
<li>Begin a low boil (about an hour). Put a lid on top.</li>
</ol>

<h2>5.4 Meat Prep</h2>
<ol>
<li>Rub salt on the beef cut (can do bones if desired also) and then wash it off. Note that this is not a proper salt bath.</li>
<ul><li>OPTIONAL: If a proper salt bath is desired, rub salt onto the beef, at 1 tbsp of kosher or seat salt (do not use table salt) per half kilogram of beef. Place the beef on a rack and refrigerate it uncovered, sitting for about 2 hours. Pat it dry with paper towels.</li></ul>
<li>Fill up a second pot with water (ideally an extremely large pot) with 90% of its max capacity minus the seasoning pot capacity</li>
<li>Add the uncooked onions to the pot (which will displace the water volume of the pot)</li>
<li>Cut the beef into thick 1-inch strips</li>
<li>Add the beef (don't forget the bones)</li>
<li>Boil on highest possible heat until a froth forms</li>
<ul><li>A thick froth insitgated by high heat (approx. 20-30 minutes) allows impurities in the meat, such as proteins and blood to coagulate</li>
<li>Skim the froth with a skimmer, like a sieve</li></ul>
<li>Lower heat to low and continue boiling for two hours or until the meat is soft (if you're using a soft cut like brisket, until the fatty bits melt in your mouth</li>
<li>While you are waiting for this pot to finish, continue to the next section</li>
</ol>
<h2>5.5 Combining Pots and Seasoning</h2>
<ol>
<li>At any point after the frothing exercise, add the initial seasoning, comprised of the following:</li>

<ul>
<li>2 tbsp sugar</li>
<li>2 heaping tbsp salt MINIMUM</li>
<li>1 cube of rock sugar</li>
<li>4 dashes of fish sauce MINIMUM</li>
<li>Optional: Chicken powder/MSG</li>
<li>Black pepper, etc.</li>

</ul>

<li>Stir, and then taste by design</li>
<li>Also, at any point following the frothing exercise, you can/MUST combine the boiled seasoning pot. However, you must strain the bulky organics out (only retain the liquid). Discard the solids</li>

<li>Continue boiling for 1.5h-2h (same step as in previous section)</li>
<li>Continue seasoning by design</li>



</ol>

<h2>Bowl and Noodle Prep</h2>
<p>The broth is done at this point and now it is time to prepare the bowl and garnishes</p>

<ol>
<li>Get a handful of pho noodles (rice vermicelli), one handful represents a serving. Two handfuls might be sufficient for one person to eat in a large bowl in one sitting</li>
<li>In your handful, rinse the raw noodles with cold water to get rid of excess manufacturing starch</li>
<li>Boil water</li>
<li>Drop in the handful of noodles and continue boiling for 5-8 minutes</li>
<li>Strain the boiling water and rinse it again in cold water to get rid of the excess starch</li>
<li>Dice finely some cilantro, at least 2 tbsp per bowl, and put it into the bowl</li>
<li>Slice a yellow onion into rings (and larger rings are halved) and serve them raw, put them on the side</li>
<li>Issue some salt, pepper, chilis, thai basil, sriracha, and hoisin sauce on the side</li>
<li>Cut thinly sliced green onion and put that into the bowl</li>
<li>Put the noodles into the bowl now that they are relatively dry</li>
<li>Serve broth into bowl and fill it up</li>
<li>With the remaining, unused, beef cut, slice thinly and place raw trimmings into the bowl and watch it cook in real-time</li>
<li>Continue garnishing with side items</li>
<li>Enjoy</li>


</ol>
