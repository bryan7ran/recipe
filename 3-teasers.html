    <h1>3.0 Previous Teasers</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>Matthew seldom expresses emotion. In fact, he only has two emotions: happy, and none. In fact, he insists on using common catchphrases that represent neutral emotion, "haha", "dangit man", "hmmm." or even stickers that don't convey emotion. See the figure below.</p>

    <p><i>Figure Caption: A rude awakening during the middle of dinner that literally tells me nothing about his inner thoughts.</i></p>
    <h2></h2>

    <p>It is to my express surprise how much emotion Matthew has shown when teasing him with this recipe and its associated progress</p>

    <p>Below is a compilation of events where I've teased him this very recipe.</p>
    <h2>8 March 2018</h2>
    <img src="img/preamble/003.png" width="450">
    <p><i>Figure Caption: He had an Android phone and I knew that the notification would show the first line of a text email so I decided to send an image of text trolling him.</i></p>


    <h2>24 April 2018</h2>
        
        
        <p>I hosted an online notebook documenting a collection of places I liked when I lived in Japan. See the pho recipe on the left side? That was good bait for Matthew when he asked me where in Japan he should visit. So I gave him this resource while adding in a sneaky OneNote page. And he fell for it gloriously. 
        </p>

    <p><i>Figure Caption: lmao</i></p>

    <h2>Mailed letter in August 2023</h2>
    <p>I mailed something for his birthday the first summer he was in Seattle. It contained most of this document but failed to arrive.</p>
        <p>Neither of us know the contents (because I honestly didnâ€™t remember what was inside. It was a lot of work. I regret not documenting this more).
        </p>

        <h2>Other Pranks</h2>
        <p>There were other pranks but they were poorly documented.</p>
